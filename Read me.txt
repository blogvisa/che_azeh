			--Overview--

	Bvslide is a jQuery slider with several transition effects. It accepts images which can optionally be nested within other elements like <a> and <li> tags. It has several customizable options including a play/pause button, a filmstrip, previous and next buttons, etc.

			--Features--

    - Six transition effects: Simple, blinds, fade, jigsaw, stack and horizontal stack.
    - Four optional navigation methods including one or more of the following:
        A filmstrip which slides automatically to display which image is being animated, in case images in the filmstrip overflow. A user can also view images further back or ahead of the slide by hovering towards the edges of the filmstrip.
        A set of numbers representing the position and amount of images in the slide.
        A set of dots representing the position and amount of images in the slide.
        User set previous and next buttons to navigate one image foward or backwards on the image stack.
    - Possibility to enable and disable automatic animation of images using the autoplay feature.
    - User-set play/pause button to halt and resume animation
    - User-set delay time between transitions.


			--Requirements--

	jQuery 1.6.1 and above



			--Basic Usage--

    Include jQuery and bvslide at the head section of your page:

    <script src = '...jquery.js' type = 'text/javascript' > </script >
    <script src = '...bvslide.js' type = 'text/javascript' > </script >
    Select the parent element of the images to slide and apply the bvslide() method to it:

    <div id='images' >
            <img src = 'image1.jpg' />
            <img src = 'image2.jpg' />
            <img src = 'image3.jpg' />
    </div>
    <script type = 'text/javascript' >
            $('#images').bvslide();
    </script>



		--Exteded Usage - Parameters--

	A single parameter is allowed which is a plain object of specific optional properties. You pass it thus:
	$('#images').bvslide({
    		effect: 'blinds',
    		navigation: 'filmstrip',
    		autoplay: true,
    		delay: 9000,
    		previous: "",
    		next: "",
    		play: "",
	});

	The above values are the defaults for all properties. You can alter them to have the following meanings:

    -- effect (string) determines what navigation effect to use. It should be supplied a string containing one fo the following values: "simple", "blinds", "jigsaw", "stack", "horizontal stack" or "fade".,
    -- navigation (string) specifies the method to use to navigate through images. It should be supplied one of the following values: "filmstrip", "numbers" or "dots". Supplying any other value makes the images void of any navigation method.
    -- autoplay (boolean) should be set to true to allow automatic animation of images and false to disallow it.
    -- play (string) is a user-defined element which halts and resumes the animation. The value should be a jQuery selector string like "#play" , pointing to the element you define as the "play" button.
    -- previous (string) should be used if you decide to include a previous button. The value should be a jQuery selector string like "#previous" , pointing to the element you define as the "previous" button.
    -- next (string) should be used if you decide to include a next button. The value should be a jQuery selector string like "#next" pointing to the element you define as the "next" button.
    -- delay (integer) should be supplied an integer determining the number of milliseconds to wait between each slide. 5000 and above is recommended. 3000 and below is discouraged.
